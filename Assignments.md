## Definitions

**_Event sourcing_** is a pattern in which state changes of an application are captured and stored in a sequence of event objects.

An **_aggregate_** is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An aggregate is unit of **consistency**.

An **_event_** represents a fact that took place within your business. Such a fact is **irrefutable**.

A **_command_** represents an intention to change the system state.

A **_command handler_** validates an incoming command and rejects or processes it by loading the affected aggregate from the repository and attempting to apply the state change.

A **_repository_** stores aggregates, typically in a database.

With event sourcing aggregates are stored (appending to) by storing their sequence of events.

**_View models_** (aka Projections) provide a way to convert a stream of events into a structural representation, e.g. the current state.

## Project structure

This projects holds a simple implementation of base classes required to implement event sourcing. These
base classes are located in the `digital.hd.workshop.eventsourcing.common.es` package.

A sample implementation of an Order aggregate is located in the `digital.hd.workshop.eventsourcing.domain.sales` package.
It holds an Order aggregate in `OrderAR.java`.
The main responsibility of the aggregate is to keep the aggregate consistent. 
It provides business methods that change the state of the aggregate. In order to check consistency the aggregate holds state.
The state of the aggregate is computed by replaying events on the aggregate every time a new event is applied.

Aggregates are stored and retrieved from a repository, see `EventSourcedRepository.java`.

A command handler is responsible for handling commands and calling business methods on the aggregate. See `OrderCommandHandler.java`.

A REST controller is provided that handles the commands. See `OrderController.java`.
The controller uses the command handler to handle the commands.

A view is a projection of the state of an aggregate. See `JDBCOrderView.java` as an example. It subscribes to events and updates a
materialized view. To illustrate you can create different views using different persistence mechanisms, there is also a `JPAOrderView.java`.
In the assignments below you only need to change the JDBC views. However, you are free to change the JPA views as well.


## Assignment 1: Getting started 

Run the application, inspect the h2 database (the URL to access the database can be found in
[README.md](/#inspecting-the-database)) and try the REST calls provided with the postman collection.

## Assignment 2: Replay the JDBCOrderView

The `JDBCOrderView` is a view that is built from the events that occur for the Order aggregate.
One of the great benefits of event sourcing is fault tolerance, which means that whenever something appears
to be wrong in either our database or in the logic that updates the view, we have to opportunity to recompute the
view.

Let's try this by corrupting our database table first and then replay the view.

Update the `ORDER_VIEW_JDBC` table and set the value of `ITEM_COUNT` for all rows to 100.

Call the `view/List orders (overview)` method using Postman. You should see that the item count is 100 for all orders.

Now let's replay the view. Call the `view/Replay order overview view` endpoint method using Postman.

If you now call the `view/List orders (overview)` method using Postman, you should see that the item count is correct again.

## Assignment 3: Extend the OrderItemAdded event

Extend classes related to the event that adds order items with a price.
The Java type of a price should be a `BigDecimal` and should be stored in the event.

You can validate your code by performing Postman requests and inspecting column `EVENT_DATA` in table `JOURNAL`.

## Assignment 4: Update the JDBCOrderView

Now we've added prices to the order items, we want to include the total price of the order in the view.
Update the `JDBCOrderView` logic that handles the OrderItemAdded event and include the total price of the order.
Please note the database creation script in `src/main/resources/schema.sql` that creates the `ORDER_VIEW_JDBC` table.

## Assignment 5: Add an OrderItemRemoved event.

Implement an additional event that removes an item from the order.
Obviously the command to remove an item from the order should only succeed if the item is actually in the order.

## Assignment 6: Update the JDBCOrderView for removed items

Update the `JDBCOrderView` logic that handles the OrderItemRemoved event and update the total price of the order.
